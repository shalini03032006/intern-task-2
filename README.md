K-means clustering groups customers based on their purchase history by minimizing the variance within clusters. It starts by selecting K initial centroids and assigning each customer to the nearest centroid. It then recalculates the centroids as the mean of the assigned points and reassigns customers iteratively. This process repeats until convergence, resulting in K distinct customer groups with similar purchasing patterns.
